# TUFS
Toy implementation of a sample FAT filesystem.

Designed for Temple University's CIS 3207 class (hence, TU FS), but I was pretty proud of it, so I decided to publish it :)

## Building (macOS & Linux)

Requires `readline` and `ncurses` system libraries.

To build the lib and REPL:
```shell
./build-all.sh
```
Running the REPL:
